# README

This repository contains code and data associated with the manuscript "A resource for development and comparison of multi-modal brain 3T MRI harmonisation approaches".

## Code

Code (jupyter notebooks) used to generate manuscript figures are available under "scripts"

## Data

We provide IDP and IQM text files containing all data necessary to generate manuscript figures under "data".

In addition, we provide a summary IDP CSV file containing all baseline IDPs and IQMs (i.e. excluding denoised IDPs).

idp_vis.ipynb - the main script for quantifying and comparing IQMs and IDPs
combat.ipynb - used to compare IDPs harmonised using implicit harmonisation tools (combat, covbat)
denoise.ipynb - used to compare denoised dMRI data IDPs to raw dMRI data IDPs
first_vs_mist.ipynb - used to compare unimodal and multimodal subcortical segmentations
freesurfer_fastsurfer.ipynb - used to compare atlas-based, Freesurfer and FastSurfer cortical parcellations

### Apparatus

Scanners:
1. Philips Achieva, 2. Philips Ingenia, 3. GE MR750, 4. Siemens Prisma (32ch), 5. Siemens Prisma (64 ch), 6. Siemens Trio

Modalities:
1. T1w, 2. T2w FLAIR, 3. diffusion MRI (dMRI), 4. resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI), 5. susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI)


### Experimental location

Scanners are located across five sites in the United Kingdom.

### Notes
Anatomical data have been defaced following the UKBB defacing procedure. Defacing masks are available in each session directory as sub-<subID>_ses-<sesID>_mod-T1w_defacemask.nii.gz.

At time of release, SWI data were not yet incorporated in to the BIDS standard. The SWI extension proposal (https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.1/06-extensions.html: accessed Autumn 2022) was used to define SWI data structure.
